Maze Game

This app was created as a hobby project to get more experience in developing android apps. The 
main feature of the app is that it can randomly generate a maze up to 256x256 within 60 seconds
on most android devices.

Code samples provided include the cornerstone algorithms of the maze generator, which are the victory
path generator and the dead end generator. The code samples also include the canvas objects that
actually handle the bulk of the rendering for the ingame state and the victory animations. Finally
the last code samples include the activities that control the ingame state and the victory state.

Screenshots included show the different views from the app, including the main menu, the setup menu,
the ingame view and the victory view.
