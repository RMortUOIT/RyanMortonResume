TicTacToe App

This app is a simple tic tac toe game that had both single player and multiplayer game modes.
Since this app was made as a school project the server that runs the multiplayer feature has
long since been shut down so the multiplayer feature has been disabled in the example APK.

Note that the "AI" in the single player feature purposely makes random nonsense moves, this is
because even the most simple decision tree AI won't do any worse than a draw so the AI is 
easy to beat as a means of testing the functionalities.

Even though the multiplayer function has been disabled there still are code samples that show
how it did run when the feature and server were active. All of the code samples are some of the
most important activities and the database helper that allows data to be stored on the device.
NOTE - Not all of the activities or classes in the project are in this example folder.

The two attached screen shots show the menu screen and the single player screen. Note that in 
the single player screen the Xs and Os at the bottom randomly spawn and fly across the panel in
different directions.
