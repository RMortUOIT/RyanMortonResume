RedBall App

This app is a demonstration of the simplified 2d rendering system on android devices. It contains
a red ball which will bounce around the screen until the user touches it, in which case the user
can move the ball around the screen where they want, once the user releases it the ball resumes 
bouncing.

The code examples in this project contain snippets of the logic of the frame-by-frame movement of
the ball and how the activity (the control part) communicates with panel (the rendering part).
