Cancer Research Database

This program was created as a school projects in order to showcase various abilities in SQL. The 
project uses an sqlite database with one million randomly generated "cancer patients" in order 
to mirror real life statistics. Using the program the user can select which data they want to 
see, including charts that help visualize statistics such as a pie chart that displays how common
certain types of cancer are.

The included mainUI code sample is a large file (about 2400 lines of code) but it was included in 
full because it showcases various skills such as dynamic JFrame creation and the graph drawing tools
as well as the SQL requests executed by the program on the database.

The generator code sample was also included because it is an additional sample of code about how the
million patient list was generated. Note that this code was intended to be single use so trying to 
run it against the database will take several hours to complete.

The screenshot included is just an example of the important parts of the UI.

NOTE that the cancerResearchDB.sqlite must be in the same folder as the CancerResearchDB.jar in order
for the JAR to function properly.
