2D Game Engine

This project was created as a hobby to learn a the basics of game development. The game is a simple
2D side scrolling game where the player must move from one side of the level to the other while
avoiding the enemy bots and falling down the pits. The user uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to
control the character.

The strength of this game engine as an example is that it was deliberately made very easy to edit all
of the materials in this game, including the levels, the backgrounds, the menus and all of the sprites
used in game. All of the levels are saved in the maps folder as a simple text file where each character
represents a specific tile (shown in the tiles folder), a blank tile is regarded as empty space.

An example of the compiled game is playable in the testGame folder and can be played by running 
the GAME.exe program. All of the materials can be eddited and is located in all of the subfolders.
NOTE that in order to run the program requires certain VS and DirectX updates to be downloaded.

This example also contains a few code samples that show the structure of the game control as well as
the objects created to control the bots and their weapons.

Example screenshots are also included in case the runnable example does not work.
